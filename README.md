# ParticleSim
Particle simulation in c++ using raylib.

## Usage
Just launch the exe in the build/Release/ folder and drag your mouse in the window to attract the particles. Press "A" on keyboard to screenshot.

## Variables
Feel free to play around with the variables inside the code.
"particleCount", "WIDTH" and "HEIGHT" are pretty important.
